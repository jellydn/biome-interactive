## Prerequisites

You need to have Go installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the [official website](https:/go.dev/dl/).

## Installation

Download the binary for your operating system and architecture from the [releases](https://github.com/jellydn/biome-interactive/releases).

Or you can install it using Go:

```bash
go install github.com/jellydn/biome-interactive@latest
```

This will install the `biome-interactive` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## Usage

After installation, you can run `biome-interactive` from your terminal:

```bash
biome-interactive
```

Follow the prompts to install Biome, initialize it, and migrate Eslint and Prettier.
