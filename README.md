## Motivation

Biome is a high-performance code formatter supporting JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and JSON, boasting a 97% compatibility rate with Prettier. To streamline the repetitive and time-consuming process of migrating from Eslint/Prettier to Biome, `biome-interactive` was developed. This CLI tool facilitates a consistent and error-free migration, enhancing both CI and development workflows.

## Install

### Using goblin.run

```bash
# goblin.run will build the binary and place it in PATH
curl -sf http://goblin.run/github.com/jellydn/biome-interactive | sh
```

### Using Go

```bash
go install github.com/jellydn/biome-interactive@latest
```

This will install the `biome-interactive` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

### Manual

Download the binary for your system from the [releases page](https://github.com/jellydn/biome-interactive/releases).

## Usage

Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
biome-interactive
```

Follow the interactive prompts to install Biome, initialize it, and migrate configurations from Eslint and Prettier.
